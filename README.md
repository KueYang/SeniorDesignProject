# UA 2017 The Senior Design Project
- Design project for the University of Akron's Electrical & Computer Engineering Program.
- Project Name: Stringless Guitar
- Purpose: Design a fully functional bass guitar without the need of strings.
- Contributors: Kue Yang, Domonic Mercorelli Nathaniel Hawks, Tony Bately.

# Design Overview:
  - Each string of the bass guitar uses a resistive sensor for detecting the finger position and note being played. 
  - All four strings ar ran in parallel.
  - Each resistive sensor is wired to a PCB board consisting of a microchip, micro SD card, amp connector circuit and power source (9v battery).
  - The micro SD card stored all notes of each string and the microchip selects the correct note and outputs the notes over to a DAC.
  - The amp connecting circuit will connect all four DAc outputs into a single audio output signal.
